1. You’re given access to an IAM user with limited permissions on AWS. How would you enumerate resources and identify potential privilege escalation paths?
2. Describe your process for identifying publicly accessible storage (e.g., S3 buckets on AWS, Blob storage on Azure). What techniques would you use to
   search for misconfigurations?     
3. If you had access to a cloud environment’s metadata API, how would you leverage it to gain further information or access?
4. What methods would you use to discover publicly exposed services and endpoints in a cloud environment?

**1. Enumerating Resources and Privilege Escalation on AWS**
To check what resources you can see with your IAM user, you can use the AWS CLI or Management Console to list services. For example, you might run a command like `aws s3 ls` to see S3 buckets. Look for roles or policies that might allow you to assume higher privileges. If you see an IAM role, check if you can assume it using `sts:AssumeRole`.

**2. Identifying Publicly Accessible Storage**
To find public storage like S3 buckets:
- **Use tools**: You can use tools like `awscli` or `s3scanner` to list buckets and their permissions.
- **Check permissions**: For example, run `aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket [bucket-name]` to see if the bucket is public. If the ACL shows `Everyone: READ`, it’s publicly accessible.
- **Search for misconfigurations**: Look for buckets that shouldn't be public, like `development-bucket`, and check if they contain sensitive data.

**3. Leveraging Metadata API**
If you have access to the cloud environment's metadata API (like AWS's `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`), you can get information about the instance, such as:
- **Instance ID**: Use it to find more about the instance.
- **Security groups**: Identify what network traffic is allowed.
- **IAM role**: Check what permissions the instance has, which could allow further actions.

**4. Discovering Publicly Exposed Services**
To find exposed services:
- **Port scanning**: Use tools like `nmap` to scan for open ports on known IPs or ranges.
- **Web enumeration**: Use tools like `curl` or `gobuster` to find hidden paths or endpoints in applications.
- **Cloud provider tools**: Some cloud providers have tools (like Azure’s Network Watcher) that can help identify public endpoints.


1. You have access to an AWS Lambda function. How would you assess it for privilege escalation opportunities or sensitive information exposure?
2. Explain how you would leverage misconfigured IAM roles or policies to escalate privileges in AWS.
3. In Azure, you find a managed identity assigned to a virtual machine. How would you use it to gain further access?
4. You gain access to an application with limited permissions. How would you identify permissions and roles to conduct lateral movement within the cloud    
   environment?
5. If you find exposed environment variables in a cloud function or container, how would you assess them for potential credentials or sensitive information?

**1. Assessing AWS Lambda for Privilege Escalation**
First, check the Lambda function's permissions by looking at its execution role. Use the AWS Console or CLI to inspect policies attached to it. Look for permissions like iam:PassRole or access to sensitive resources (like S3 or DynamoDB). Check the function's code for hardcoded credentials or environment variables that may contain sensitive information.

**2. Leveraging Misconfigured IAM Roles or Policies**
If you find an IAM role that allows you to assume another role or has permissions to manage IAM (like iam:CreatePolicy), you could escalate your privileges by creating a new policy granting you admin access. For example, you could run aws iam create-policy to create a policy with *:* permissions and then attach it to your user.

**3. Using Managed Identity in Azure**
A managed identity assigned to a VM can be used to access other Azure resources. You can use the identity to authenticate against services like Azure Key Vault or Azure Storage. For example, use the identity to request a token and access secrets in Key Vault, which might include credentials or connection strings.

**4. Identifying Permissions for Lateral Movement**
To find roles and permissions in a cloud environment, check the application’s access tokens or API keys. Use tools or APIs to list roles and their permissions (e.g., aws iam list-roles for AWS). Look for service accounts or roles that can access other resources, allowing lateral movement.

**5. Assessing Exposed Environment Variables**
If you find exposed environment variables, review them for sensitive information like API keys, database connection strings, or access tokens. Use tools or scripts to automate the checking of common patterns (e.g., checking if a variable looks like a credential). Document any sensitive findings for further action.

1. You find a misconfigured S3 bucket with sensitive data but no write access. How would you use this data to expand your access in the environment?
2. Describe how you would exploit improper security group configurations in an AWS or Azure environment to gain further access.
3. You’ve identified an EC2 instance with SSH access open to the internet. How would you assess and potentially exploit this misconfiguration?
4. In a GCP environment, you find a service account with broad permissions. How would you use it to access other resources? 

**1. Using Data from a Misconfigured S3 Bucket**
If you find sensitive data in an S3 bucket but can't write to it, look for:

Credentials: If the data includes access keys, API keys, or database credentials, you can use these to access other services.
Configuration Files: Files like .env or config files might have valuable information on how the environment is set up, helping you find more targets or vulnerabilities.
Data Leakage: Check if the data contains PII or company secrets that could be used for social engineering or other attacks.

**2. Exploiting Improper Security Group Configurations**
If you find overly permissive security groups:

Open Ports: Identify services running on open ports. For example, if SSH (port 22) or RDP (port 3389) is open, you might try to brute force weak passwords.
Inter-Service Communication: If security groups allow access between services (e.g., an EC2 instance can access a database), use that access to extract data or perform unauthorized actions.
Network Scanning: Use tools to scan for other instances or services that might be exposed due to misconfigurations.

**3. Assessing and Exploiting an EC2 Instance with Open SSH Access**
For an EC2 instance with open SSH access:

Brute Force: Attempt to brute force SSH credentials if you suspect weak passwords.
Key Pair Attack: If you can find any SSH key pairs in public repositories or in the previously identified S3 bucket, try using those to gain access.
Enumeration: Once inside, enumerate users, installed software, and configurations to find ways to escalate privileges or access other resources.

**4. Using a Service Account with Broad Permissions in GCP**
With a service account that has broad permissions:

API Access: Use the service account to call Google Cloud APIs to access or modify other resources (like GCS buckets, Cloud SQL databases, etc.).
Token Theft: If you can gain access to the service account key or token, you can impersonate the service account to perform actions on behalf of it.
Resource Enumeration: List and assess all resources accessible to the service account to find sensitive data or further escalation paths.

1. You find an exposed API endpoint in a cloud-hosted application. How would you assess it for vulnerabilities, such as IDOR or improper permissions?
2. Describe how you would conduct a password spraying attack against cloud-based services without triggering account lockouts.
3. In a multi-cloud environment, explain how you would pivot from one cloud provider to another if credentials are shared or reused.
4. How would you assess Kubernetes clusters hosted in cloud environments (e.g., EKS, AKS, GKE) for misconfigurations or privilege escalation?
5. You gain access to a CI/CD pipeline in a cloud environment. How would you leverage this to expand your access and potentially introduce malicious code?

**1. Assessing an Exposed API Endpoint for Vulnerabilities**
To assess an exposed API endpoint:

Testing for IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References): Try manipulating parameters in the URL (like user IDs) to see if you can access other users' data. For example, changing api/users/1 to api/users/2 might reveal data for a different user.
Permission Checks: Check if the API properly verifies user permissions. Attempt to access endpoints with different user roles to see if you can access restricted data.
Input Validation: Send unexpected input (e.g., SQL injection payloads) to check for vulnerabilities in how the API handles data.

**2. Conducting a Password Spraying Attack**
To perform a password spraying attack without triggering lockouts:

Use a List of Common Passwords: Focus on a small number of common passwords (e.g., "Password123") across many accounts rather than trying multiple passwords on one account.
Rate Limiting: Space out your attempts to avoid triggering lockouts. For example, wait several minutes between attempts on different accounts.
Targeted Accounts: Focus on accounts that are likely to have weak passwords, like service accounts or those with less critical access.

**3. Pivoting in a Multi-Cloud Environment**
To pivot from one cloud provider to another:

Credential Reuse: Check if credentials from one provider (like AWS) work in another (like Azure or GCP). For example, if you find an AWS access key, try it on the Azure CLI if it’s part of an IAM user email.
Shared Resources: Identify services that may be using shared APIs or federated identities. For example, if a service in AWS connects to a database in GCP, gaining access to one might give insights into accessing the other.
Data Exfiltration: If you find sensitive data in one environment, look for ways to access the other cloud provider through that data, like connection strings or API keys.

**4. Assessing Kubernetes Clusters for Misconfigurations**
To assess Kubernetes clusters (like EKS, AKS, GKE):

Access Control: Check RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) settings to see if users have excessive permissions. Use kubectl auth can-i to verify permissions.
Network Policies: Review network policies for overly permissive rules that could allow unauthorized access between pods.
Audit Logs: Analyze logs to identify suspicious activities or misconfigurations that could lead to privilege escalation.

**5. Leveraging Access to a CI/CD Pipeline**
To expand access through a CI/CD pipeline:

Introduce Malicious Code: If you can modify code in the repository, insert malicious code into build scripts or application code.
Modify Pipeline Configurations: Change build configurations to deploy backdoors or exfiltration scripts alongside legitimate updates.
Access Secrets: Use the CI/CD environment to retrieve sensitive data (like API keys) stored in environment variables or secrets management systems.
