## What is Cybersecurity

```bash
  Cybersecurity is like keeping your house safe from burglars but in the digital world. It involves protecting computer systems, networks, and data from theft, damage, or unauthorized access
```

## Offensive Security vs. Defensive Security:

```bash
Offensive Security: This is like being a burglar (the good kind). It's about finding weaknesses in systems before the bad guys do. For example, ethical hackers and penetration testers simulate attacks to uncover vulnerabilities.
Defensive Security: This is like being the security guard. It's about setting up defenses to protect against attacks. For example, installing firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption to keep data safe.
```

## SOC (Security Operations Center):

```bash
This is like a command center for cybersecurity. It's where experts monitor and analyze security alerts and incidents in real-time to defend against cyber threats.
```

## Threat Intelligence:

```bash
This is like being a detective. It involves gathering information about potential cyber threats such as malware, hacking techniques, and vulnerabilities to better prepare defenses.
```

## DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response):

```bash
This is like investigating a crime scene in the digital world. It involves collecting and analyzing evidence from cyber incidents to understand what happened and how to prevent it in the future.
```

## Malware Analysis:

```bash
This is like dissecting a virus to understand how it works. It involves studying malicious software to identify its behavior, origins, and potential impact on systems.
```

## Roles in Security Infrastructure:

```bash
- **Penetration Tester:** This person tries to break into systems to find weaknesses before attackers do.
- **Red Teamer:** They simulate attacks to test an organization's defenses and find vulnerabilities.
- **Security Engineer:** They design and implement security systems to protect against cyber threats.
- **Incident Responder:** They investigate and respond to security incidents, like breaches or attacks, to minimize damage.
- **Security Analyst:** They monitor systems for security breaches and analyze security threats to keep the organization safe.
- **Digital Forensic Examiner:** They investigate cyber incidents, collect evidence, and analyze digital data to understand and mitigate security breaches.
