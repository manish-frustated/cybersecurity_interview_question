# Cybersecurity Interview question




## Vulnerability Assessment vs. Penetration Testing:

```bash
  Vulnerability Assessment: Identifies and quantifies vulnerabilities in a system. It involves scanning the system for known vulnerabilities.
  Example: Using tools like Nessus to scan a network for known vulnerabilities in software
  
  Penetration Testing: Simulates real-world attacks to exploit vulnerabilities. It aims to determine the extent to which an attacker can gain unauthorized access.
  Example: Ethical hackers attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in a web application to gain access to sensitive data.
