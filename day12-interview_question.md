Common vulnerability: Common vulnerabilities include misconfigured systems, outdated software versions, and weak password policies. Attackers often exploit these gaps to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.

Daily task: My tasks include scanning for vulnerabilities, monitoring logs for suspicious activity, and applying patches or fixes. Additionally, I ensure secure configurations and enforce security policies.

XSS: Cross-site scripting (XSS) injects malicious scripts into web pages, tricking users into executing them. Mitigation includes sanitizing and validating user inputs to prevent script injection.

Reflected XSS vs DOM XSS: Reflected XSS occurs when a script is reflected off a web server and executed immediately in the user’s browser. DOM XSS manipulates the DOM directly within the browser without server involvement.

Vulnerability on login: Login vulnerabilities include brute-force attacks, SQL injection to bypass authentication, and session management issues like session fixation. Mitigations include rate-limiting, strong passwords, and secure session handling.

SQL Injection: SQL injection exploits flaws in SQL queries by injecting malicious code to manipulate databases. Mitigation involves using parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate code from user input.

Blind vs Boolean-based SQLi: Blind SQL injection occurs when no direct feedback is given from the database, while Boolean-based SQLi relies on true/false responses to infer information. Both can reveal sensitive data covertly.

Mitigate headers: Use security headers like X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME type sniffing, Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS, and X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking.

Mitigate CSP: Content Security Policy (CSP) restricts sources of content such as scripts, styles, and media. A strict CSP limits potential attack vectors by only allowing trusted content sources.

LFI vs RFI: Local File Inclusion (LFI) allows an attacker to include local files from the server, while Remote File Inclusion (RFI) loads external files. LFI is more common since RFI often requires remote code execution capabilities.

Directory listing vs traversal: Directory listing exposes files and directories to the user, potentially leaking sensitive files. Directory traversal (path traversal) allows attackers to access files outside the intended directory structure.

RCE: Remote Code Execution (RCE) allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server remotely. Mitigation includes strict input validation, patching software vulnerabilities, and running services with least privilege.

OWASP Top 10: The OWASP Top 10 includes major web security risks like Injection, Broken Authentication, Sensitive Data Exposure, XSS, and Security Misconfigurations. These are critical for securing web applications.

Types of injection: Injection vulnerabilities include SQL injection, Command injection (injecting OS commands), LDAP injection (exploiting LDAP queries), and XML injection (manipulating XML parsers).

Leaving organization: I am seeking new challenges and professional growth opportunities that align with my career development. I am also looking to expand my expertise and contribute to a dynamic team.

Mitigate RCE: To mitigate RCE, enforce strong input validation, apply regular patches and updates, and ensure the principle of least privilege is followed for running services and applications.

Types of API: APIs can be categorized as REST (stateless architecture using HTTP), SOAP (a protocol with more strict standards), and GraphQL (a query language for APIs allowing more flexible data requests).

Types of XSS: XSS comes in three forms: Stored XSS (stored on the server and served to users), Reflected XSS (immediate response in user requests), and DOM-based XSS (manipulates the client-side DOM directly).

RCE vs LFI/RFI: RCE allows execution of arbitrary code on a server, potentially taking over the system. LFI and RFI are file inclusion vulnerabilities, which may escalate to RCE if combined with other flaws.

Nmap flags: -sS performs a stealth SYN scan, -sC runs default scripts, -sT initiates a full TCP connect scan, and -sV identifies software versions running on open ports for fingerprinting services.

API OWASP Top 10: This list includes API-specific vulnerabilities like Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA), excessive data exposure, lack of rate-limiting, and improper authentication mechanisms.

Network pentesting approach: A typical approach includes reconnaissance (gathering network info), vulnerability scanning, exploitation of discovered weaknesses, and post-exploitation analysis to assess potential damage.

Famous hacking port: Common ports targeted by attackers include 22 (SSH for remote access), 80/443 (HTTP/HTTPS for web services), and 3389 (RDP for remote desktop connections).

Web app PT approach: Web app pentesting involves gathering intelligence, scanning for known vulnerabilities, manual testing to identify business logic flaws, and reporting findings with recommendations.

Mobile app PT approach: Reverse engineer the app, assess local storage and API communications, test for insecure data transmission, and look for insecure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

SSL pinning: SSL pinning forces an app to only trust certain SSL certificates, preventing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. It verifies the certificate directly against a known set of valid certificates.

Android VAPT methodology: Static analysis to examine code, dynamic analysis to observe runtime behavior, testing API security, and reverse engineering for potential vulnerabilities in the mobile application.

CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) controls how web applications share resources. To mitigate, restrict Access-Control-Allow-Origin to trusted domains and avoid using * wildcard.

CSRF: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tricks users into submitting unauthorized requests. Mitigation includes using anti-CSRF tokens, checking referer headers, and enforcing same-site cookie policies.

CLRF injection: CLRF injection occurs when an attacker inserts carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) into headers or logs. Mitigation involves input validation and proper encoding of user inputs.

XXE: XML External Entity (XXE) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in XML parsers, potentially allowing data exfiltration or DoS. Mitigation involves disabling external entity processing in XML parsers.

Thick vs Thin client: A thick client handles most of the processing on the client-side (local machine), while a thin client relies on a central server for processing and resources.

OTP bypass mitigation: Ensure strong OTP generation mechanisms, limit OTP retries, implement rate-limiting, and tie OTP to specific sessions to prevent replay attacks.

Mass assignment: Occurs when an attacker modifies object properties by sending additional data. Mitigation includes specifying allowed properties and filtering input fields in API requests.

Privilege escalation: Gaining higher privileges than intended. Vertical escalation involves gaining admin-level access, while horizontal escalation involves accessing other users’ data without permission.

Parameter pollution: Attacker injects multiple parameters into a request to override functionality. Mitigation includes proper input validation and rejecting duplicated parameters.

SSTI injection: Server-Side Template Injection occurs when an attacker injects code into templates, leading to RCE. Mitigation includes input sanitization and avoiding direct user inputs in templates.

HTTP request smuggling: Manipulates HTTP request parsing between frontend and backend servers, causing desynchronization. Mitigation includes using consistent request parsers and updating server software.

IDOR: Insecure Direct Object Reference allows unauthorized access to resources via exposed object references. Mitigation includes strict access control and proper authorization checks.

HTTP request smuggling: Exploits differences in how servers process HTTP requests. Attackers can bypass security controls by sending specially crafted requests. Mitigation: Update and configure servers properly.

IDOR vs Privilege escalation: IDOR allows access to resources via direct object manipulation, while privilege escalation involves gaining unauthorized access to higher privilege levels.

Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption: Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a public-private key pair.

Encryption vs Encoding: Encryption secures data by making it unreadable without a key, while encoding converts data into a specific format for transmission without securing it.
