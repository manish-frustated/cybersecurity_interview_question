## Android system architecture layers

```bash
  Layer 1: Linux Kernel: This is the core of the Android operating system, providing low-level system functionalities such as process management, memory management, and hardware drivers. In terms of penetration testing, vulnerabilities at this layer could include privilege escalation exploits or vulnerabilities in device drivers. For example, an attacker might exploit a vulnerability in the Linux kernel to gain root access to the device.

    Layer 2: Libraries (and Libraries Runtime): This layer includes various libraries required for running applications, such as the C standard library (libc), SQLite library for database operations, and SSL libraries for secure communication. Penetration testing at this layer involves identifying vulnerabilities in these libraries that could be exploited by malicious apps. For instance, a vulnerability in the SSL library could lead to sensitive data being intercepted by an attacker during secure communication.

    Layer 3: Application Framework: This layer provides high-level building blocks for developing Android applications, including components like activities, services, and content providers. Penetration testing here involves assessing the security of these components for potential vulnerabilities such as insecure data storage or improper input validation. For example, an attacker might exploit a vulnerability in an Android activity to perform unauthorized actions or access sensitive data.

    Layer 4: Applications: These are the actual user-facing applications installed on the Android device. Penetration testing at this layer involves assessing the security of individual apps for vulnerabilities such as insecure data transmission, weak authentication mechanisms, or improper session management. For instance, a banking app might have a vulnerability that allows an attacker to steal login credentials or perform unauthorized transactions.
