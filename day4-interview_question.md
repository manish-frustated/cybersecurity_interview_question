## Red v/s Blue v/s Purple Team

```bash
   Red Team: The red team simulates cyber-attacks to find weaknesses in a company's defenses. They act like hackers, trying to break into systems, steal data, or disrupt operations. For example, a red team might attempt to breach a company's network by using phishing emails or exploiting software vulnerabilities.

   Blue Team: The blue team defends against attacks and monitors systems for suspicious activity. They are like the security guards of the company, constantly watching for any signs of intrusion or unusual behavior. For instance, the blue team might use firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security protocols to protect the company's network.

   Purple Team: The purple team combines elements of both the red and blue teams. Instead of working separately, they collaborate closely to share insights and improve overall security. The red team helps identify weaknesses, while the blue team implements defenses and measures the effectiveness of those defenses. This collaboration ensures that the company's security posture is continuously strengthened.

   For example, imagine a company hires a red team to perform a penetration test. The red team discovers a vulnerability in the company's web application that could allow an attacker to access sensitive customer data. They report this to the blue team, who then patches the vulnerability and implements additional security measures to prevent similar attacks in the future. Throughout this process, the purple team facilitates communication and collaboration between the red and blue teams to ensure a comprehensive security response.

 IP Addresses

```bash
   
```

## IP Address: 
```bash
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It identifies the location of a device in a network. For example, `192.168.1.1`.
```

## IPv4 and IPv6: 

```bash
   IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) are two different versions of the Internet Protocol. IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing for a total of 2^32 addresses, while IPv6 uses a 128-bit address scheme, providing significantly more addresses. An IPv4 address looks like `192.168.1.1`, while an IPv6 address looks like `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
```

## MAC Address: 
```bash
MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on a network segment. It's a hardware address that identifies a device uniquely. For example, `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.
```

## TCP, UDP, and Three-Way Handshake:
```bash
   - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of packets. It establishes a connection-oriented communication and guarantees data delivery.
   - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Provides connectionless, unreliable communication. It's faster but doesn't ensure data delivery.
   - **Three-Way Handshake**: A process in TCP connection establishment where three packets are exchanged between client and server to establish a reliable connection. It involves SYN (synchronize), SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledgment), and ACK (acknowledgment) packets.
```

## Router, Hub, Switch, Bridge:
```bash
   - **Router**: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
   - **Hub**: A simple networking device that connects multiple Ethernet devices together. It operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model and broadcasts data to all devices.
   - **Switch**: A more intelligent networking device that forwards data only to the intended recipient device. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
   - **Bridge**: Similar to a switch, it connects multiple network segments and forwards data only when necessary. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
```

## Ports and Protocols: 
```bash
Ports are endpoints used by protocols to facilitate communication between devices. Protocols define rules and conventions for communication between devices. For example, HTTP uses port 80, and FTP uses port 21.
```

## IP Subnetting: 
```bash
IP subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller sub-networks (subnets) to improve performance and security. It helps in efficient utilization of IP addresses.
```

## CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): 
```bash
CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing. It allows for more flexible allocation of IP addresses than the older class-based system. For example, `192.168.1.0/24` represents a CIDR notation where `/24` denotes the number of bits in the network portion of the address.
