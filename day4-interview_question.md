## Red v/s Blue v/s Purple Team

```bash
   Red Team: The red team simulates cyber-attacks to find weaknesses in a company's defenses. They act like hackers, trying to break into systems, steal data, or disrupt operations. For example, a red team might attempt to breach a company's network by using phishing emails or exploiting software vulnerabilities.

   Blue Team: The blue team defends against attacks and monitors systems for suspicious activity. They are like the security guards of the company, constantly watching for any signs of intrusion or unusual behavior. For instance, the blue team might use firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security protocols to protect the company's network.

   Purple Team: The purple team combines elements of both the red and blue teams. Instead of working separately, they collaborate closely to share insights and improve overall security. The red team helps identify weaknesses, while the blue team implements defenses and measures the effectiveness of those defenses. This collaboration ensures that the company's security posture is continuously strengthened.

   For example, imagine a company hires a red team to perform a penetration test. The red team discovers a vulnerability in the company's web application that could allow an attacker to access sensitive customer data. They report this to the blue team, who then patches the vulnerability and implements additional security measures to prevent similar attacks in the future. Throughout this process, the purple team facilitates communication and collaboration between the red and blue teams to ensure a comprehensive security response.
