## Red v/s Blue v/s Purple Team

```bash
   Red Team: The red team simulates cyber-attacks to find weaknesses in a company's defenses. They act like hackers, trying to break into systems, steal data, or disrupt operations. For example, a red team might attempt to breach a company's network by using phishing emails or exploiting software vulnerabilities.

   Blue Team: The blue team defends against attacks and monitors systems for suspicious activity. They are like the security guards of the company, constantly watching for any signs of intrusion or unusual behavior. For instance, the blue team might use firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security protocols to protect the company's network.

   Purple Team: The purple team combines elements of both the red and blue teams. Instead of working separately, they collaborate closely to share insights and improve overall security. The red team helps identify weaknesses, while the blue team implements defenses and measures the effectiveness of those defenses. This collaboration ensures that the company's security posture is continuously strengthened.

   For example, imagine a company hires a red team to perform a penetration test. The red team discovers a vulnerability in the company's web application that could allow an attacker to access sensitive customer data. They report this to the blue team, who then patches the vulnerability and implements additional security measures to prevent similar attacks in the future. Throughout this process, the purple team facilitates communication and collaboration between the red and blue teams to ensure a comprehensive security response.

## IP Address: 
```bash
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It identifies the location of a device in a network. For example, `192.168.1.1`.
```

## IPv4 and IPv6: 

```bash
   IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) are two different versions of the Internet Protocol. IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing for a total of 2^32 addresses, while IPv6 uses a 128-bit address scheme, providing significantly more addresses. An IPv4 address looks like `192.168.1.1`, while an IPv6 address looks like `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
```

## MAC Address: 
```bash
MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on a network segment. It's a hardware address that identifies a device uniquely. For example, `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.
```

## TCP, UDP, and Three-Way Handshake:
```bash
   - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of packets. It establishes a connection-oriented communication and guarantees data delivery.
   - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Provides connectionless, unreliable communication. It's faster but doesn't ensure data delivery.
   - **Three-Way Handshake**: A process in TCP connection establishment where three packets are exchanged between client and server to establish a reliable connection. It involves SYN (synchronize), SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledgment), and ACK (acknowledgment) packets.
```

## Router, Hub, Switch, Bridge:
```bash
   - **Router**: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
   - **Hub**: A simple networking device that connects multiple Ethernet devices together. It operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model and broadcasts data to all devices.
   - **Switch**: A more intelligent networking device that forwards data only to the intended recipient device. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
   - **Bridge**: Similar to a switch, it connects multiple network segments and forwards data only when necessary. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
```

## Ports and Protocols: 
```bash
Ports are endpoints used by protocols to facilitate communication between devices. Protocols define rules and conventions for communication between devices. For example, HTTP uses port 80, and FTP uses port 21.
```

## IP Subnetting: 
```bash
IP subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller sub-networks (subnets) to improve performance and security. It helps in efficient utilization of IP addresses.
```

## CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): 
```bash
CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing. It allows for more flexible allocation of IP addresses than the older class-based system. For example, `192.168.1.0/24` represents a CIDR notation where `/24` denotes the number of bits in the network portion of the address.
```

##  Anti-virus detection technology

```bash
1. **Signature-based detection**: Think of this like recognizing a wanted poster for a criminal. Antivirus software uses signature-based detection by comparing files on your computer to a database of known malware signatures. If a file's signature matches one in the database, it gets flagged as malware. For example, if there's a known virus called "Trojan Horse X," the antivirus will detect it if it finds a file with the exact signature of Trojan Horse X.

2. **Heuristic-based detection**: This is like recognizing suspicious behavior even if you don't have a specific warning about it. Antivirus software uses heuristic-based detection by looking for behaviors that might indicate malware, even if it doesn't match a known signature. For instance, if a program tries to modify system files or access sensitive areas of your computer, the antivirus might flag it as potentially harmful based on its behavior.

3. **Behavior-based detection**: Similar to heuristic-based detection, this method focuses solely on the behavior of programs. Instead of looking for specific signs of malware, it watches how programs act on your computer. For example, if a program suddenly starts encrypting a lot of files rapidly, behaving like ransomware, the antivirus might intervene, even if it doesn't recognize the specific ransomware variant.

4. **Machine learning detection**: This involves teaching computers to recognize malware by showing them lots of examples. Instead of relying solely on fixed rules or patterns, machine learning algorithms analyze data and learn from it. For example, a machine learning model might be trained on thousands of examples of malware and non-malware files. Over time, it learns to distinguish between the two based on various features, such as file structure, code behavior, or even language patterns. So, if a new file behaves similarly to known malware files, the machine learning model might flag it as a potential threat, even if it doesn't have a specific signature.
```

## Reverse Shell and Bind Shell:
```bash
   Reverse Shell: In a reverse shell attack, an attacker connects to a compromised system from an external machine. The compromised system opens a network connection to the attacker's machine, giving the attacker remote access to execute commands on the compromised system.
   Example: Attacker runs a command on the victim's system to connect back to the attacker's machine, granting the attacker remote access to execute commands.
   
   Bind Shell: In a bind shell attack, the attacker sets up a service on a compromised system that listens for incoming connections. When a connection is made, the attacker gains access to execute commands on the compromised system.
   Example: Attacker sets up a service on a compromised server, and when the attacker connects to that service, they gain remote access to execute commands on the compromised system.
```

## Credential Stuffing and Password Spraying:
```bash
   Credential Stuffing: In credential stuffing, attackers use lists of previously stolen usernames and passwords to try to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on various websites or systems. They automate the process of trying these combinations at scale.
   Example: An attacker uses a list of usernames and passwords leaked from one website to try to log in to various other websites, hoping that users have reused the same credentials.
   
   Password Spraying: In password spraying, attackers use a single password (or a small set of passwords) and try them against many different user accounts. This method reduces the risk of getting locked out due to multiple failed login attempts.
   Example: An attacker tries a common password like "password123" against thousands of different user accounts across various systems.
```

## Shell Code and Staged/Non-Staged Payloads:
```bash
   Shell Code: Shell code is a small piece of code that an attacker injects into a vulnerable system to gain control or execute specific actions. It's often used in exploits to take control of a system.
   
   Staged Payloads: In a staged payload, the payload is delivered in multiple stages. The initial payload might be small and simple, just enough to establish a connection or download additional code. Then, additional code is downloaded and executed to complete the attack.
   Example: An attacker delivers a small payload that establishes a connection to a command and control server. Once connected, the server sends further instructions or additional code to execute on the compromised system.

   Non-Staged Payloads: In a non-staged payload, the entire payload is delivered at once. There's no need for multiple stages as the payload itself contains all the necessary code to execute the desired actions.
   Example: An attacker sends a payload that directly executes the desired malicious actions, such as deleting files or creating backdoors, without the need for additional downloads or instructions from a command and control server.
```
## Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol
```bash
   What is RPC?
   RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call. It's a protocol that allows one computer to execute code on another computer over a network.

   How does RPC work?
   RPC works like this:A program on one computer wants to execute code on another computer.
   It sends a request over the network to the remote computer.
   The remote computer receives the request, executes the code, and sends back the result.
   
   What are some examples of RPC on Windows systems?
   An example of RPC on Windows is when you share a printer over a network. When you print a document from your computer, it sends an RPC request to the computer where the printer is connected. That computer then processes the print job and sends back the result to your computer.
