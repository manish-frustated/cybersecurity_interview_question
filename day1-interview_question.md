# Cybersecurity Interview question




## What is Cybersecurity

```bash
  Cybersecurity is like keeping your house safe from burglars but in the digital world. It involves protecting computer systems, networks, and data from theft, damage, or unauthorized access
```

## Offensive Security vs. Defensive Security:

```bash
Offensive Security: This is like being a burglar (the good kind). It's about finding weaknesses in systems before the bad guys do. For example, ethical hackers and penetration testers simulate attacks to uncover vulnerabilities.
Defensive Security: This is like being the security guard. It's about setting up defenses to protect against attacks. For example, installing firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption to keep data safe.
```

## SOC (Security Operations Center):

```bash
This is like a command center for cybersecurity. It's where experts monitor and analyze security alerts and incidents in real-time to defend against cyber threats.
```
## Threat and Threat actors
```bash
  threat in cybersecurity is anything that has the potential to cause harm to your computer systems, networks, or data. Threat actors are the entities or individuals behind these threats, like hackers or malicious software creators.

  Here's an example: Imagine you have a door (your computer system) with a lock (your cybersecurity measures) to keep it secure. A threat could be someone trying to pick the lock (a hacker) or a virus trying to break through the door (malware). These hackers or viruses are the threat actors. They're the ones trying to breach your cybersecurity defenses and cause harm.
```
## Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Exploits
```bash
  1. **Risks**: These are potential events or situations that could harm an organization's assets, operations, or reputation. In cybersecurity, risks often involve the possibility of unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruptions. For example, the risk of a hacker gaining access to sensitive customer information.

  2. **Threats**: Threats are the potential sources of danger that can exploit vulnerabilities in a system. These can include hackers, malware, disgruntled employees, or even natural disasters. For example, a threat could be a malicious attacker attempting to steal login credentials through a phishing email.

  3. **Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a system's security posture that could be exploited by threats to cause harm. These weaknesses could be in software, hardware, processes, or even human behavior. An example of a vulnerability is outdated software that hasn't been patched, leaving it open to exploitation by malware.

  4. **Exploits**: Exploits are specific techniques or tools used by attackers to take advantage of vulnerabilities and carry out malicious activities. This could involve using known software bugs to gain unauthorized access to a system or executing code remotely. For example, a hacker might use a known exploit to bypass a firewall and gain access to a company's internal network.

  5. **Threat Modelling**: Threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying and prioritizing potential threats to a system. It involves analyzing the system's architecture, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and assessing the likelihood and impact of different threats. For example, in threat modeling, a company might identify that its web application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks and prioritize implementing measures to mitigate this threat.
```
## Threat Intelligence:

```bash
This is like being a detective. It involves gathering information about potential cyber threats such as malware, hacking techniques, and vulnerabilities to better prepare defenses.
```

## DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response):

```bash
This is like investigating a crime scene in the digital world. It involves collecting and analyzing evidence from cyber incidents to understand what happened and how to prevent it in the future.
```

## Malware Analysis:

```bash
This is like dissecting a virus to understand how it works. It involves studying malicious software to identify its behavior, origins, and potential impact on systems.
```

## Operating System Security

```bash
Operating system security involves protecting the operating system from unauthorized access, malicious software, and other threats. 
```

## CIA Triad
```bash
The CIA triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. It is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. Confidentiality ensures that information is only accessible to authorized users, integrity ensures that information is accurate and unaltered, and availability ensures that information is accessible when needed.
```

## Network Security

```bash
Network security involves protecting computer networks from unauthorized access, misuse, and disruptions. This includes measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), encryption, and virtual private networks (VPN) to safeguard network traffic and data. 
```
## PCI DSS & NIST Cybersecurity Framework
```bash
  1. PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):
   - PCI DSS is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.
   - It's like a rulebook that companies handling credit card information must follow to keep that data safe.
   - Example: If you have ever made a purchase online and entered your credit card details, the website you used must comply with PCI DSS to ensure your information isn't stolen by hackers.

  2. NIST Cybersecurity Framework:
   - The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a set of guidelines, best practices, and standards to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks.
   - It provides a structured approach to cybersecurity, dividing it into five key functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
   - Think of it as a toolbox for organizations to assess and improve their cybersecurity posture.
   - Example: A company might use the NIST framework to identify its critical assets (Identify), put up firewalls and encryption (Protect), install intrusion detection systems (Detect), have an incident response plan (Respond), and develop a backup system (Recover) in case of a cyber attack.
```
## Firewall, IDS, IPS, VPN, Antivirus

```bash
   - **Firewall**: A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.
   - **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**: An IDS is a security tool that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations. It detects and alerts administrators about potential security threats.
   - **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**: An IPS is similar to an IDS but has the capability to take automated actions to block or prevent detected threats in real-time.
   - **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It’s like a secret tunnel on the internet that keeps your online activities private and secure. Suppose you’re in India, and you want to use Spotify (which isn’t available there).
   - **Antivirus**: Antivirus software is designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware) such as viruses, worms, and Trojans from computers and networks.
```

## Cyber Kill Chain Methodology

```bash
Think of the Cyber Kill Chain Methodology as a step-by-step guide that hackers often follow when they're planning and executing a cyber attack. 

1. **Reconnaissance**: Hackers gather information about their target. For example, they might look for weaknesses in a company's website or network.

2. **Weaponization**: They create or obtain the tools they need to carry out the attack. This could be anything from a piece of malicious software to a phishing email.

3. **Delivery**: They deliver the weapon to their target. This might involve sending the malicious software as an email attachment or tricking someone into clicking a link.

4. **Exploitation**: The weapon is activated, taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the target's systems. For instance, if the target's software hasn't been updated, it might have a known security flaw that the hacker can exploit.

5. **Installation**: The hacker gains a foothold in the target's system, often by installing malware or creating a backdoor for future access.

6. **Command and Control**: Once they're inside, the hacker establishes control over the compromised system. They might use this control to gather more information, spread the attack to other systems, or carry out other malicious activities.

7. **Actions on Objectives**: Finally, the hacker achieves their goal, whether it's stealing sensitive data, causing disruption, or something else.

By understanding these steps, cybersecurity professionals can better defend against cyber attacks by breaking the chain at any point or by detecting and responding to attacks more effectively.
```

## MITRE ATT&CK framework

```bash
The MITRE ATT&CK framework is like a roadmap that helps cybersecurity professionals understand how cyber attackers operate. It breaks down the different tactics and techniques that attackers use during various stages of an attack. Here's an explanation in simple terms with an example:

Imagine you have a castle, and there are bad guys (attackers) trying to break in. The MITRE ATT&CK framework helps you understand how these bad guys might try to get into your castle and what you can do to stop them.

1. **Initial Access**: This is how the bad guys first get into your castle. They might climb over the walls, sneak through a secret passage, or even trick a guard into letting them in. For example, they might send a phishing email pretending to be the king, tricking someone into clicking on a malicious link that lets them into the castle's network.

2. **Execution**: Once inside, the bad guys need to do something to cause harm. They might steal valuable treasure, sabotage defenses, or plant a bomb. For example, they might install malware on the castle's computers to steal important documents or disrupt the castle's defenses.

3. **Persistence**: The bad guys want to stay inside your castle for as long as possible without getting caught. They might hide in the shadows, disguise themselves as servants, or build secret tunnels. For example, they might create a backdoor in the castle's security system to allow them to come and go unnoticed.

4. **Privilege Escalation**: To do more damage, the bad guys might try to gain more power or access higher levels of the castle. They might steal keys, bribe guards, or exploit weaknesses in the castle's defenses. For example, they might find a way to access the king's account and gain control over the entire castle.

5. **Defense Evasion**: If the castle's defenses start to catch on, the bad guys will try to avoid getting caught. They might use decoys, distractions, or disguise themselves as harmless visitors. For example, they might encrypt their communications to make it harder for the castle's guards to intercept them.

6. **Credential Access**: Sometimes, the bad guys need special keys or passwords to access certain areas of the castle. They might steal these credentials from unsuspecting guards, crack them using special tools, or trick someone into giving them up. For example, they might use a fake login page to steal the passwords of castle employees.

7. **Discovery**: Before launching a full-scale attack, the bad guys need to gather information about the castle's layout, defenses, and weaknesses. They might scout around, eavesdrop on conversations, or hack into the castle's surveillance systems. For example, they might use drones to fly over the castle and take pictures of its defenses.

8. **Lateral Movement**: Once inside the castle, the bad guys might need to move around to find what they're looking for. They might use secret passages, crawl through vents, or hack into other parts of the castle's network. For example, they might use stolen credentials to access different rooms and steal valuable treasures.

9. **Collection**: This is where the bad guys gather all the information or treasures they came for. They might steal valuable artifacts, copy important documents, or download sensitive data. For example, they might use malware to steal the castle's blueprints or plans for its defenses.

10. **Exfiltration**: Finally, once they've got what they want, the bad guys need to get out of the castle without getting caught. They might sneak out through a hidden tunnel, disguise themselves as ordinary travelers, or use encryption to hide their tracks. For example, they might upload stolen data to a remote server and delete all traces of their presence in the castle's network.

By understanding these different stages of an attack, cybersecurity professionals can better defend against them and keep their castles safe from harm.
```

## OWASP Top 10 2021

```bash
1. **Broken Access Control**: This means not properly restricting what users can do. For example, imagine if a regular user could access an admin panel and change important settings.

2. **Cryptographic Failures**: This is about messing up encryption, which can lead to exposing sensitive information. For instance, if a website stores passwords in a way that hackers can easily decode them.

3. **Injection**: This happens when attackers insert malicious code into a system. A common example is SQL injection, where attackers can manipulate a website's database by inserting code into a form field.

4. **Insecure Design**: This is about flaws in how a system is built, like not considering security from the start. An example could be designing a login system without thinking about how to prevent brute force attacks.

5. **Security Misconfiguration**: This is when system settings are left insecure. For instance, leaving default passwords on a server, making it easy for attackers to gain access.

6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: This is when using outdated software with known security flaws. It's like using an old version of a library that has a known bug hackers can exploit.

7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**: This means failing to properly identify users. For example, a website not requiring strong passwords or allowing easy password resets.

8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**: This is about not ensuring that software and data remain intact and unaltered. For instance, if updates to a software are not properly verified, hackers could inject malicious code.

9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: This is about not keeping track of what's happening in a system. For example, if a system doesn't log login attempts, it's harder to detect if someone is trying to break in.

10. **Server-Side Request Forgery**: This means allowing attackers to make requests to a server from the server itself. For example, if a website allows users to input URLs for the server to fetch data from, attackers could use this to access sensitive information within the server's network.

In an interview, these points might be discussed to understand how someone approaches securing web applications and their understanding of common security risks.

## SANS Top 25

```bash
SANS Top 25 is a list of the most dangerous software errors compiled by the SANS Institute, a prominent cybersecurity training organization. Each item on the list represents a common programming mistake that can lead to security vulnerabilities in software systems.

1. Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787): This occurs when a program writes data beyond the boundaries of allocated memory. For example, if you have an array in a program with space for 10 elements, but the program tries to write data to the 11th element, it could overwrite important information or cause a crash.

2. Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79): This happens when a web application doesn't properly sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. For instance, if a website allows users to input comments and doesn't properly filter out scripts, an attacker could inject a script that steals users' cookies or redirects them to a malicious website.

3. SQL Injection (CWE-89): This occurs when a web application doesn't properly sanitize user input before incorporating it into SQL queries. Attackers can then manipulate these queries to access or modify sensitive data in the database. For example, if a login form doesn't properly validate user input, an attacker could input SQL commands to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system.

4. Use After Free (CWE-416): This occurs when a program continues to use memory after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes. For instance, if a program deallocates memory used by an object but continues to reference that object, it may inadvertently overwrite or access invalid memory.

5. Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (OS Command Injection) (CWE-78): refers to a vulnerability where an application takes user input and passes it directly to a system command without proper validation or sanitization. This can allow attackers to inject malicious commands into the system, leading to unauthorized actions such as executing arbitrary commands, altering system configurations, or accessing sensitive data.

6. Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): This happens when a program doesn't properly validate input from users or external sources, allowing attackers to inject unexpected data. For example, if a web application accepts user input without verifying its format or content, it could be vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows or injection attacks.

7. Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125): Similar to out-of-bounds write, this occurs when a program reads data from memory beyond the boundaries of allocated memory. This can lead to information disclosure or crashes. For example, if a program tries to read data from an index beyond the end of an array, it may access uninitialized or sensitive data.

8. Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (Path Traversal) (CWE-22): This occurs when a program allows users to access files or directories outside of the intended directory structure. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive files or execute arbitrary code on the system. For example, if a web application allows users to specify file paths without proper validation, an attacker could traverse directories to access system files or execute malicious scripts.

9. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352): This vulnerability occurs when a web application trusts requests sent by a user without verifying their authenticity. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to trick users into unintentionally performing actions on the application, such as changing their account settings or making financial transactions. For example, an attacker could craft a malicious website that automatically submits requests to a vulnerable web application on behalf of the user, without their knowledge.

10. Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434): This vulnerability occurs when a web application allows users to upload files without proper validation, potentially allowing malicious files to be uploaded and executed on the server. For example, if a website allows users to upload profile pictures without checking the file type, an attacker could upload a malicious script disguised as an image file, leading to server compromise or data loss.

11. Missing Authorization (CWE-862): This occurs when a software application fails to properly enforce access controls, allowing unauthorized users to access privileged functionality or sensitive data. For example, if a web application allows any authenticated user to access administrative functions without proper authorization checks, it could result in unauthorized access to sensitive information or system compromise.

12. NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476): This vulnerability occurs when a program attempts to dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash or unexpected behavior. Null pointers typically arise when a program fails to properly handle error conditions or uninitialized variables. For example, if a program tries to access a memory location pointed to by a null pointer, it may result in a segmentation fault or other runtime error.

13. Improper Authentication (CWE-287): This vulnerability occurs when a system fails to properly verify the identity of a user or entity, allowing unauthorized access to restricted resources or functionality. For example, if a web application relies solely on client-side validation for user authentication without server-side verification, attackers could bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.

14. Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190): This vulnerability occurs when an arithmetic operation results in an integer value that exceeds the maximum representable value for the data type, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. For example, if a program calculates the size of a buffer using integer arithmetic and does not properly handle overflow, it may allocate insufficient memory, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

15. Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502): This vulnerability arises when a program deserializes data from an untrusted source without proper validation, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or manipulate the application's behavior. For example, if a web application deserializes user-supplied data without verifying its integrity, an attacker could craft malicious serialized objects to exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process.

16. CWE-77 : Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') : same as no. 5

17. Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119): This vulnerability occurs when a program performs operations on memory buffers without proper bounds checking, leading to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues. For instance, if a program copies data into a fixed-size buffer without verifying that the data will fit within the buffer's boundaries, it may overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to crashes or security vulnerabilities.

18. Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798): This vulnerability occurs when sensitive credentials, such as passwords or API keys, are hard-coded into the source code of an application, making them easily discoverable by attackers. For example, if a program includes a default administrative password that is the same across all installations, an attacker could exploit this weakness to gain unauthorized access to the system.

19. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918): This vulnerability arises when a web application allows attackers to make arbitrary requests to internal or external resources from the server-side, potentially leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure. For example, if a web application accepts user-provided URLs for making HTTP requests without proper validation, an attacker could manipulate these URLs to access sensitive internal resources or perform malicious actions on external systems.

20. Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306): This vulnerability occurs when a critical function within an application is accessible without proper authentication, allowing unauthorized users to perform sensitive operations. For instance, if an administrative function in a web application can be accessed without requiring users to log in or verify their credentials, it may expose the application to unauthorized manipulation or data compromise.

21. Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization (Race Condition) (CWE-362): This vulnerability occurs when multiple threads or processes access shared resources concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable behavior or security vulnerabilities. For example, if two threads in a program access and modify the same variable without proper locking mechanisms, it may result in race conditions where the outcome depends on the timing of each thread's execution, potentially leading to data corruption or security vulnerabilities.

22. Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269): This vulnerability occurs when a software application does not properly enforce access controls or privileges, allowing users to perform actions or access resources that they should not be authorized to. For example, if a web application allows regular users to access administrative functionalities without proper authorization checks, it could lead to unauthorized actions or data breaches.

23. Improper Control of Generation of Code (Code Injection) (CWE-94): This vulnerability arises when an application allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary code within the application's runtime environment. For instance, if a web application dynamically generates code from user inputs without proper validation or sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious code, leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or system compromise.

24. Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863): This vulnerability occurs when a software application incorrectly verifies user permissions or fails to enforce proper access controls, allowing unauthorized users to access restricted functionalities or resources. For example, if a mobile application allows users to access premium features without proper authentication or payment verification, it could lead to revenue loss or unauthorized usage.

25. Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276): This vulnerability occurs when default permissions are set insecurely, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities. For example, if a file-sharing application sets default permissions to allow public access to all files uploaded by users, it could lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information or data leakage.
```

## Active directory
```bash
  Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft technology used in managing users, computers, and other devices on a network. It acts like a central hub, organizing and providing access to network resources like files, folders, printers, and more. Let's break down its components:
  
  ### Physical Components:
  
  1. **Data Store**: This is where all the information about users, computers, and network resources is stored. It's like a big database for your network.
  
  2. **Domain Controller**: Think of this as the boss of a specific area on the network, called a domain. It manages user logins, passwords, and access to resources within its domain.
  
  3. **Global Catalog Server**: This is like a special library that holds a summary of information about all the objects in the entire network. It helps in finding things quickly across different domains.
  
  4. **Read-only Domain Controller (RODC)**: This is a special type of domain controller that only stores read-only copies of the AD database. It's useful in remote locations with limited connectivity.
  
  ### Logical Components:
  
  1. **Partitions**: Imagine dividing your AD database into different sections, each containing specific types of information.
  
  2. **Schema**: Think of this as the blueprint or design of your AD database. It defines the types of objects (like users, computers) and the attributes (like name, email) they can have.
  
  3. **Domains**: Picture domains as separate neighborhoods in a city, each with its own rules and security settings. Users in one domain may not automatically have access to resources in another domain.
  
  4. **Domain Trees**: Imagine multiple neighborhoods (domains) connected together in a hierarchy, forming a tree-like structure. This allows for easier management and organization of resources.
  
  5. **Forests**: Think of forests as entire cities made up of multiple neighborhoods (domains) connected together. They share a common schema and global catalog.
  
  6. **Sites**: Picture different physical locations in your organization, like offices or branches. Sites help in organizing network traffic efficiently and applying specific settings based on location.
  
  7. **Organizational Units (OUs)**: These are like folders within domains where you can organize users, computers, and other objects based on departments, teams, or any other criteria you choose.
  
  **Example**:
  
  Let's say you work at a company called ABC Corp. In ABC Corp's Active Directory:
  
  - The data store is like the company's main filing cabinet where all employee information is kept.
  - Each office building has a domain controller managing access to resources within that building.
  - The global catalog server is like a library catalog that helps you find books (or network resources) quickly across different departments.
  - In the logical realm, imagine ABC Corp as a city. Each department (HR, IT, Sales) is like a neighborhood (domain) with its own rules and security.
  - These neighborhoods are organized into a tree structure (domain tree) with a common city plan (schema).
  - ABC Corp may have multiple cities (forests) if it has different branches or subsidiaries.
  - Sites help in managing network traffic efficiently between different office locations.
  - OUs are like filing cabinets within each department where you can organize employees based on teams or projects.
  
  Understanding these components helps in efficiently managing and organizing the network resources within an organization.
