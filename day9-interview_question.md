## ISO 9001:2015

```bash
ISO 9001:2015 is a standard that helps organizations ensure they meet the needs of their customers while maintaining high-quality products and services. It provides a framework for establishing a quality management system (QMS) that encompasses everything from management commitment to continuous improvement.

Here's a simple breakdown with an example:

    1. **Understanding Customer Needs**: Imagine you own a bakery. ISO 9001:2015 would require you to understand what your customers want, such as fresh bread, tasty cakes, and excellent service.

    2. **Establishing Processes**: You'd then need to establish processes to meet those needs. For example, you'd have processes for baking, customer service, and delivery.

    3. **Quality Control**: ISO 9001:2015 emphasizes quality control. In your bakery, this means ensuring that every loaf of bread meets certain standards, like being properly baked and free from contaminants.

    4. **Continual Improvement**: The standard encourages continual improvement. For your bakery, this might involve regularly seeking customer feedback, updating your recipes, or improving your delivery times.

    5. **Documentation and Records**: ISO 9001:2015 also emphasizes documentation and record-keeping. This ensures that you have a clear record of your processes and any changes made for future reference.

Overall, ISO 9001:2015 helps organizations like your bakery consistently deliver high-quality products and services by focusing on customer satisfaction, process improvement, and adherence to standards. Good luck with your interview!

## ISO 9001:2015 v/s ISO 27001:2013

```bash
The main difference between ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 27001:2013 lies in their focus and scope:

1. **ISO 9001:2015** is a standard focused on quality management systems (QMS). It outlines requirements for organizations to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve a quality management system to enhance customer satisfaction by meeting customer requirements and improving processes.

   - Focus: Quality management, customer satisfaction, and process improvement.
   - Scope: Applicable to all types of organizations, regardless of size, industry, or product/service provided.

2. **ISO 27001:2013**, on the other hand, is centered around information security management systems (ISMS). It specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an ISMS to manage information security risks and protect sensitive information assets.

   - Focus: Information security management, protecting sensitive information assets, and managing risks.
   - Scope: Primarily focused on ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information within an organization.

While both standards share some common elements, such as the emphasis on continual improvement and the importance of management commitment, they address different aspects of organizational management:

- ISO 9001:2015 primarily concerns quality management and customer satisfaction.
- ISO 27001:2013 focuses on information security management and protecting sensitive information assets.

In summary, ISO 9001:2015 is about ensuring quality in processes and products/services, while ISO 27001:2013 is about safeguarding information assets and managing information security risks. Depending on the nature of the organization and its priorities, it may choose to implement one or both of these standards to address its management system requirements.
