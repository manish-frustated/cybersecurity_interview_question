ISO 27001:2013 is an international standard that outlines the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS) within an organization. It's designed to help organizations manage and protect their sensitive information assets, such as financial data, intellectual property, and customer information, in a systematic and consistent manner.

2. **Risk Assessment and Treatment**: The standard emphasizes conducting a thorough risk assessment to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to your information assets. For example, you might identify risks such as cyberattacks, data breaches, or unauthorized access to patient records.

3. **Implementing Controls**: Based on the results of the risk assessment, you'd need to implement appropriate controls to mitigate identified risks. These controls could include measures such as encryption of patient data, access controls to limit who can view or modify records, and regular security updates to software systems.

4. **Monitoring and Measurement**: ISO 27001:2013 requires organizations to monitor and measure the effectiveness of their information security controls regularly. In the healthcare example, this might involve monitoring access logs to detect any suspicious activities or conducting penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities in the system.

5. **Management Review and Continual Improvement**: The standard encourages management to review the ISMS regularly to ensure its effectiveness and suitability. This could involve reviewing security incidents, conducting audits, and seeking feedback from stakeholders to identify areas for improvement.

6. **Documentation and Records**: Similar to ISO 9001:2015, ISO 27001:2013 emphasizes documentation and record-keeping to demonstrate compliance with the standard. This includes documenting policies, procedures, risk assessments, and security incidents.

Overall, ISO 27001:2013 helps organizations like the healthcare company establish a systematic approach to managing information security risks, protect sensitive information assets, and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
